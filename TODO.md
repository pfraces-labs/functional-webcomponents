# To Do

## Features

- [x] Create an abstraction to define custom elements using a render function
- [x] Read data from element attributes
- [x] HyperScript-like syntax
- [ ] Passing complex data to components
- [ ] Dispatching events from components
- [ ] Template interpolation (with or without `<slot>`)
- [ ] Listen to state changes and re-render
- [ ] Fine-grained reactivity (re-render only what is needed)

## Research

- [ ] Benefits and drawbacks of using Shadow DOM
- [ ] Component contents: `constructor` vs `connectedCallback`
- [ ] Benefits and drawbacks of using `<template>` clones
- [ ] Aren't elements created with `document.createElement` innert?
- [ ] How to theme Shadow DOM CSS (CSS vars?)
- [ ] Change detection (`Proxy` vs `MutationObserver` vs getters/setters)
